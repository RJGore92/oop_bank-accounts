# Epicodus Unit 4.2: Object-Oriented JavaScript: Bank Accounts

#### Assignment Three of Object-Oriented JavaScript in unit 4.2, Start Date: 04/23/2019

#### By **Robert James "Jimmy" Gore**

## Description

The purpose of this project is to further demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming in an application in which the user is capable of creating and managing one or more bank accounts.  Each bank account will be an object with a handful of details, such as the type of account, money stored, bank name, account holder, and more if necessary.  Upon application startup, the program will ask for initial information regarding the account's owner, bank name, and initial deposit, as well as information regarding what type of account is being created.  When the account is created, a new display will be set to show display the info input as well as an interface to deposit and withdraw money from the account, or to make payments if the account is a type capable of doing so (such as a checking account or credit account).

With the account's creation, the program will request a minimum initial deposit greater than zero, and require information about the account's bank, account type, and holder.  After the creation of the account, the user interface will present an input on the left along with two buttons for depositing or withdrawing the amount of money that has been input.  A third button will be present in the event that the account is a checking account or credit account and will also apply a small "service fee" confirmation when clicked, assuming there is enough money in the account.  To the right of that will be the total money remaining in the account on display, and beneath both will be a toggleable option for reviewing transaction history.  Each account will be contained within its own jumbotron, and the transaction history will contain information up to a certain number of transactions.
